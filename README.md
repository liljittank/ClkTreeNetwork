# Clock Tree Network 
This project simulates designed Clock Tree Network Circuit circuit and determines its performance characterstics

Note: This network requires further optimization to improve performance. Design yet to be modified.

## Clock Tree Network Reference IP

This paper discusses strategies for clock tree design, focusing on minimizing skew, delay, and power consumption—key aspects to consider in your CMOS clock tree network project. It covers fundamental techniques like clock tree synthesis (CTS) and balancing methodologies to enhance clock distribution performance in high-speed digital circuits.
